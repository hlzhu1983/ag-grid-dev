    <h2>Set Filtering</h2>

    <p>
        <?php include '../enterprise.php';?>
        &nbsp;
        Set filtering is available in ag-Grid Enterprise.
    </p>

    <p>
        A set filter, influenced by how filters work in Microsoft Excel. Set filters can be provided with
        additional options through the filterParams attribute.
    </p>

    <h3>Filter Parameters</h3>

    <p>
        An additional attribute on the column definition, filterParams, can be used to provide extra information to
        the set filter. Set the filterParams on the columnDefinition as follows:
    </p>

    <pre>
columnDefinition = {
    headerName: "Athlete",
    field: "athlete",
    filter: 'set',
    filterParams: {cellRenderer: countryFilterCellRenderer, cellHeight: 20, values: ['A','B','C'], newRowsAction: 'keep'}
}</pre>

    <p>
        The set filter params are specific to each filter and have the following meanings:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li><b>cellRenderer:</b> Same as cell renderer for grid (you can use the same one in both locations).
            Setting it separatly here allows for the value to be rendered differently in the filter.</li>
        <li><b>cellHeight:</b> The height of the cell.</li>
        <li><b>values:</b> The values to display in the filter. If this is not set, then the filter will
            takes it's values from what is loaded in the table. Setting it allows you to set values where a) the
            value may not be present in the list (for example, if you want to show all states in America so
            that the user is not confused by missing states, even though states are missing from the dataset
            in the grid) and b) the list is not available (happens when doing server side filtering in pagination
            and infinite scrolling).</li>
        <li><b>newRowsAction:</b> What to do when new rows are loaded. The default is to reset the filter,
            as the set of values to select from can have changed. If you want to keep the selection, then
            set this value to 'keep'. This can be useful if you are using values (above) or otherwise know that the
            list to select from will not change. If the list does change, then it can be confusing what
            to do with new values into the set (should they be selected or not??).</li>
        <li><b>apply:</b> Set to true to include an 'Apply' button with the filter and not filter
            automatically as the selection changes.</li>
        <li><b>suppressRemoveEntries:</b> Set to true to stop the filter from removing values that are no
            longer available (like what Excel does).</li>
        <li><b>comparator(a,b):</b> Comparator for sorting. If not provided, the colDef comparator is used. If colDef
            also not provided, the default (agGrid provided) comparator is used.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <note>
        The comparator for a set filter is only provided the values as the first two parameters, whereas the comparator for the colDef
        is also provided the row data as additional parameters. This is because when sorting rows, row data exists. For example,
        take 100 rows split across the colors {white,black}. The colDef comparator will be sorting 100 rows, however the
        filter will be only sorting two values.
        <br/>
        If you are providing a comparator that depends on the row data, and you are using set filter, be sure to provide
        the set filter with an alternative comparator that doesn't depend on the row data.
    </note>

    <h3>Set Filters Example</h3>

    <p>
        The example below demonstrates the set filter.
        Notice that the athlete column is given the set of filters, providing some filter options for which
        no corresponding rows exist - this can be used if you are missing items in what would otherwise be
        a complete list, if listing days of the week, and no data for Wednesday exists, then presenting
        the filter to the user could give the impression that the filter is broken because it is missing
        Wednesday as an option.
    </p>

    <p>
        The example also demonstrates using the <i>ag-header-cell-filtered</i> class, which is applied to the header
        cell when the header is filtered. By default, no style is applied to this class, the example shows
        applying a different color background to this style.
    </p>

    <h3>Set Filter API</h3>
    <p>
        The set filter API is as follows:
    <ul>
        <li><b>setMiniFilter(newMiniFilter)</b>: Sets the filter at the top of the filter (the 'quick search' in the popup)</li>
        <li><b>getMiniFilter()</b>: Gets the mini filter text.</li>
        <li><b>selectEverything()</b>: Selects everything</li>
        <li><b>selectNothing()</b>: Clears the selection</li>
        <li><b>isFilterActive()</b>: Returns true if anything except 'everything selected'</li>
        <li><b>unselectValue(value)</b>: Unselects a value</li>
        <li><b>selectValue(value)</b>: Selects a value</li>
        <li><b>isValueSelected(value)</b>: Returns true if a value is selected</li>
        <li><b>isEverythingSelected()</b>: Returns true if everything selected (inverse of isFilterActive())</li>
        <li><b>isNothingSelected()</b>: Returns true if nothing is selected</li>
        <li><b>getUniqueValueCount()</b>: Returns number of unique values. Useful for iterating with getUniqueValue(index)</li>
        <li><b>getUniqueValue(index)</b>: Returns the unique value at the given index</li>
        <li><b>getModel() / setModel()</b>: Gets the filter as a model, good for saving and restoring.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
