            Today see's the release of version 4.x of ag-Grid. This is the first release offering both free and
            enterprise versions. From now on, the ag-Grid core
            project (formally ag-Grid) is split into ag-Grid (free and covered by MIT license) and ag-Grid-Enterprise
            (not free, covered by a Commercial license).
        </p>

        <p>
            A lot of thought has gone into this change. I understand that this will upset some people
            in the community. However I believe this change was needed for a project like ag-Grid to exist. Let me
            share some light on what is actually happening:
        </p>

        <p>
            During 2015, ag-Grid was a pet project, it was what I spent most hours doing outside of my
            day job. I estimate 20 hours per week on average was put into ag-Grid. This meant my personal life
            took a back seat.
        </p>

        <p>
            In 2016 I had to choose between my personal life, my job and ag-Grid, so I quite my job to focus on ag-Grid
            full time and get back my life. So far during this time I have taken
            a step back from the code and implemented large changes to keep the codebase healthy. For example one
            of the major changes is ag-Grid now has it's
            own IoC container and Component library - the frameworks out there in my opinion are not suitable for
            a complex widget like ag-Grid. My full time commitment allows this technical ownership and what is
            allowing ag-Grid excel over other grids. Grids are complex systems,
            ag-Grid is one of the most complex projects I have worked on.
        </p>

        <p>
            I do not accept PR's without going through them all with a fine tooth comb. I do not release code
            without doing full regression testing (takes about one full day). I constantly refactor as complexity
            grows to keep the foundations capable of managing a complex system. Large features that I implement
            take me days of undistracted full dedication, dedication that would not be given if this project was to
            remain a pet project.
        </p>

        <p>
            So in summary, this project only has a future if I can work on it full time. If this doesn't turn into
            a revenue stream, then I'm going to have to find a job, and this project will stagnate. On the other hand,
            if this project succeeds, well we are just getting started. There is so much more we can do. I am excited
            about the prospects of where next. It would be great if I could get a small team hired to help me, really
            taking things forward and killing the 'what grid do we use' question once and for all.
        </p>

        <p>
            Some questions and answers that I have anticipated:
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>How do you decide what features go into ag-Grid-Enterprise?</b><br/>
            In my head I asked "what features are above and beyond what the other grids are offering"
            and decided to have that as a reference point on what should be provided for free vs paid. So if you are
            looking for a grid that pretty much matches the other free ones for features (but kills them on peformance
            and quality!) then you can use ag-Grid free version if you are on a budget.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Are there new enterpsie features, or did you just move items around?</b><br/>
            There are plenty of new enterprise features in version 4 for example clipboard interaction, range cell
            selection, status panel (to auto aggregation of selected ranges), the documentation has a new section
            for ag-Grid-Enterprise where you can see all the features included. Future releases will contain
            more enterprise features as this area is explored. From the previous version,
            I moved row grouping, aggregation, setFilter and toolPanel into the ag-Grid-Enterprise (I do not intend to
            move anything else). If you are using these features currently, then you have the choice of a) do not upgrade
            and continue to use the version you are on b) upgrade and stop using these features or c) get a license for and
            start using ag-Grid-Enterprise.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>ag-Grid-Enterprise is on Github, is it open source?</b><br/>
            Yes. ag-Grid-Enterprise is open source and still commercial. Anyone can view the code, but you are not allowed
            to copy it as it is copyright. If you pay a licene then you are free to fork the code and make changes for
            your own personal use.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>What is the future of the free version?</b><br/>
            The enterprise version depends on the free version, there is no duplication of logic. So going forward the
            free version will continue to receive new features to the core grid along with normal maintenance and
            bug fixes.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Does absolutly everyone have to pay for the enterprise version?</b><br/>
            It's free to use for non-profit organisations or for educational use.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>I don't agree with what you have done...</b><br/>
            Feel free to use ui-Grid or slickGrid, grids that come to mind who do not have a commercial model around them.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>But I gave you a sizable donation through PayPal, and I now have to pay?</b><br/>
            I am very grateful to anyone who has donated over the past year. If / when you enquire about an enterprise
            license, please note to me who you are so I can match your kindness with discount (not one for one, I'll be nicer!!).
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>What about support?</b><br/>
            Support for the free version will stay the same, you are free to raise issues in the ag-Grid forum, and
            someone from ag-Grid may help with no guarantee. For the enterprise version, an new members forum now
            exists where members can post and get guaranteed support.
        </p>

        <p>
            I hope this will be the first step in getting ag-Grid onto a whole new level. I plan in one year from now
            to have ag-Grid explode with regards features capabailities. If we can get funding via sales, well the
            sky is the limit.
        </p>

        <p>
            Best regards,<br/>
            Niall Crosby.
