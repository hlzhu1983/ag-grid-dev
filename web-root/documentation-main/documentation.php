<p>
    ag-Grid is an Enterprise Grade Javascript Data Grid.
    The purpose of ag-Grid is to provide a data grid that enterprise
    software can use for building applications such as
    reporting and data analytics, business workflow and data entry.
    The author, having spent years building applications in C++, Java and Javascript,
    found the choice of grids in JavaScript lacking, especially in
    comparison to what was in other languages frameworks. ag-Grid is
    the result of turning frustration into answers,
    providing a grid worthy of enterprise development.
</p>

<p>
    Here you will find documentation of every feature with at least
    one example demonstrating that feature. The ag-Grid project doesn't consider a feature complete unless it is
    documented and demonstrated.
</p>

<h2>
    Where to start
</h2>

<p>
    If you are introducing yourself to ag-Grid, then you should read <a href="../angular-grid-getting-started/">Getting Started</a>.
    Then follow on to the section on the framework that interests you (one of
    <a href="../best-javascript-data-grid/index.php">Javascript</a>,
    <a href="../best-react-data-grid/index.php">React</a>,
    <a href="../best-angularjs-data-grid/index.php">Angular JS</a>,
    <a href="../best-angular-2-data-grid/index.php">Angular 2</a> or
    <a href="../best-web-component-data-grid/index.php">Web Components</a>) and try and get a simple example working
    yourself (you don't need to understand the grid, just how to install it into your application).
    Then cover the <a href="../javascript-grid-interfacing-overview/index.php">Interfacing Overview</a>.
    After that, you then have the foundations of ag-Grid and can jump to whatever section of the documentation
    you need to the feature you are trying to implement.
</p>

<h2>
    Sections
</h2>

<p>
    The documentation is broken in the following sections:
    <ul>
    <li><b>The Basics: </b> Learn how to set up ag-Grid with the framework that you have chosen.</li>
    <li><b>Interfacing: </b> A quick reference guide detailing all the configuration options for ag-Grid.</li>
    <li><b>Core Features: </b> A detailed look at all the core features.</li>
    <li><b>Enterprise Features: </b> A detailed look at all the enterprise features.</li>
    <li><b>Examples: </b> Some examples combining different features.</li>
    <li><b>Tutorials: </b> Some video tutorials for those who prefer YouTube videos over reading.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>
    ag-Grid Roadmap
</h2>

<p>
    Below are listed the 'next big things' on the roadmap for ag-Grid. During the development,
    other smaller items will be included. The next major release of ag-Grid will be released once
    one or more of the below are complete. All of these are being developed out in coordination with
    large ag-Grid clients including one leading investment bank in London and one leading fund
    management company in Canada.
</p>

<h4>Enhanced Editing (ag-Grid free)</h4>

<p>
    The core editing and navigation will be revamped, to allow users to work with editing the data as easy as
    working in Excel. Expect a new type 'cellEditor' to be added, allowing your editors to integrate with the
    built in navigation and editing of the grid.
</p>

<h4>Pinnable Filters in Tool Panel (ag-Grid enterprise)</h4>

<p>
    Modern reporting tools show filters in a panel, so you can interact with a set of filters
    concurrently. ag-Grid will allow this option by having a 'pinnable' option on the filters, which
    when clicked, will move the filter to the tool panel (the right hand panel that currently has
    column management). This will allow the tool panel to host and display multiple filters concurrently.
</p>

<h4>Big Data View (ag-Grid-Enterprise)</h4>

<p>
    A new data model type (in addition to the existing three that are 1 - plain, 2 - pagination and 3 - virtual pagination)
    that will allow viewing
    infinite amounts of data (as far as the grid is concerned) through a virtual web view. The concept
    will be similar to the current virtual pagination but far more advanced. The view will support
    aggregations, parent / child and drill-down. The target for this is to sit on top of the new
    generation of 'big data' stores, allowing an easy navigation experience on top of very large data.
    This feature will be of particular interest to corporations with large stores of risk, trade and market data.
</p>

<h4>Smaller Items (all for ag-Grid free)</h4>

<p>Plus the following smaller items:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Adding / removing rows without required to call setRowData()</li>
    <li>Components inside the grid with full control of the row (ie will support grids inside grids)</li>
</ul>
