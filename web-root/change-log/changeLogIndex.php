    <h3>Version 4.0.x</h3>

    <!-- NEW FEATURES -->
    <h4>New Features</h4>

    <li>The grid has moved to Enterprise vs Free.</li>

    <li>Enterprise Feature: Enhanced enterprise column menu, in addition to filtering there is now a menu and also column management.</li>

    <li>Enterprise Feature: Row group panel on top of grid, so you can drag columns to here to group.</li>

    <li>Enterprise Feature: You can now drag columns from the tool panel into the grid to make them visible.</li>

    <li>Enterprise Feature: Row grouping and aggregation are no longer in the tool panel as they can be done
    bia column menu (grouping and aggregation) or dragging to the row group panel (grouping).</li>

    <li>Enterprise Feature: Context Menu</li>

    <li>Enterprise Feature: Range Selection</li>
    <li>Enterprise Feature: Enterprise column menu</li>
    <li>Enterprise Feature: Clipboard interaction</li>
    <li>Enterprise Feature: Status bar</li>

    <li>Tool panel, set filter, row grouping and aggregation are now only available in Enterprise version
    of ag-Grid.</li>

    <!-- ENHANCEMENTS -->
    <h4>Enhancements & Changes</h4>

    <li>Performance improvements - no longer attaching listeners to each cell, so when scrolling, the dom is not
    been ripped up with adding and removing listeners. Instead the grid has one listener (eg for mouse click),
    and when the click happens, the grid then works out which cell it was for.</li>

    <li>rowNode is now a class object with methods (previously it only have properties, a simple data object).
        Methods now include: setSelected(), isSelected(), addEventListener(), removeEventListener(),
        resetQuickFilterAggregateText(), deptFirstSearch(callback).
    </li>

    <li>RowNode now has method 'setSelected'. This should now be used for row selection over the gridApi.selectXXXX() methods.</li>

    <li>api.getSelectedNodesById gone, use api.getSelectedNodes instead</li>

    <li>Event rowDeselected gone, now event rowSelected gets fired for both selected and deselected. Check node state
        to see if row is selected or not.</li>

    <li>Event selectionChanged no longer contains the selected rows or nodes. Use the API to look these up if needed.
        Preparing these lists took CPU time, so it's best they are only prepared if needed.</li>

    <li>Concept of 'suppressEvents' was dumped for row selection. No other event event type had this feature, and it
        was out of sync with how web components work in general. If you don't want to be notified of an event, then remove
        your event listener.</li>

    <li>api.addVirtualRowListener is gone. Instead for row selection/deselection listening, use node.addEventListener(),
        and for virtual row removed, use api.addRenderedRowListener()</li>

    <li>New API methods: getFirstRenderedRow() and getLastRenderedRow(), to know the first and last rows in the DOM
        (the grid only renders enough rows (plus a buffer) to show what's visible for performance reasons).</li>

    <li>Introduced property modelType, set to 'pagination' or 'virtual' for pagination and virtual pagination.
        This replaces virtualPaging, as virtual was a boolean when in fact we need to distinctly model three modes
        of operation: Normal, Pagination and Virtual Pagination.</li>

    <li>rowsAlreadyGrouped replaced with getNodeChildDetails. If you are providing already grouped data to the grid,
    see the new section 'Tree Data' on how this is now done. It had to change because Node is now an object with
    functinality, so you can't just pass in JSON an expect them to be treated like nodes.</li>

    <li>Renamed: columnApi.getState()/setState()/resetState() to columnApi.getColumnState()/setColumnState()/resetColumnState() </li>

    <li>Floating rows can now be selected and navigated.</li>

    <li>processRowPostCreate callback, so you can process the grid row after it is created. Handy for adding attributes or other stuff to the row after create.</li>

    <li>Now CSV export allows you to format cells on their way out. Handy if you want to import into Excel and need to make dates, for example, into Excel formatted dates.</li>

    <li>New colDef properties suppressAggregation and suppressRowGroup for suppressing aggregation and row group for particular columns</li>

    <li>Added new property: suppressFieldDotNotation</li>

    <li>Took out property groupHideGroupColumns, if you don't want a column to be shown, just hide it. This feature was not necessary and caused complexity in the design.</li>

    <li>Removed api.refreshRowGroup() -> it wasn't documented, and I can't remember why I put it in, refreshing the grid has the same effect.</li>

    <li>api.getValue(colKey, node) replaces api.getValue(colDef, node, data), the colDef and data were 'old design', newer method works much better.</li>

    <li>api.getFocusedCell() -> now returns rowIndex and Column (used to return colDef and rowNode, colDef not needed as you can get from Column, rowNode not needed as you can lookup using rowIndex)</li>

    <li>rowNode attributes floatingTop and floatingBottom removed, now floating is no longer a boolean, it's a string that can be 'top' or 'bottom' if floating.</li>

    <li>setFocusedCell(rowIndex, colId) is now setFocusedCell(rowIndex, colKey, floating).</li>

    <!-- BUG FIXES -->
    <h4>Bug Fixes</h4>

    <li>Text filter 'ends with' was not working correctly if search string appeared twice in the text.</li>

    <li>forPrint was occasionally given 'Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'appendChild' of undefined'. now fixed. </li>

    <!-- NO VIRTUAL DOM -->
    <h4>RIP Virtual DOM</h4>

    Took out virtual dom. This was an implementation detail, no change in how you interface with the grid.
    It only made an improvement on IE, and now that we are using delayed scrolling, IE is
        working fast enough now. In addition, I have now tested with Windows 10 and Edge (the IE replacement) and
        it's work very fast. So the virtual DOM was giving very little benefit and was 'getting in the way' of a clean
        design. So I've favored a clean design rather than a more complex design just to get it faster in IE. If
        you want to see how little difference a virtual DOM made, see the Angular Connect 2015 talk I gave.

    <h3>Version 3.0.0</h3>

    <p>
        Version 3 is a major version and has breaking changes. Where possible, the grid will hint if you are using an old property.
    </p>

    <ul>
    <li>Major: Grouping of headers is now called 'columnGrouping' and can now take multiple levels of groups.</li>
    <li>Major: Pinning can now be done on the left and right, previously was just the right.</li>
    <li>Major: Row pivoting is now called row grouping. So the two types of grouping are now called Row Grouping and Column Grouping. Pivoting was taken out as it wasn't true pivoting. The was done to allow true pivoting to happen in a future release and avoid any name clashes.</li>
    <li>Major: gridOptions.groupKeys and gridOptions.groupAggFields are now gone. These were duplicated ways of setting rowGroups and rowAggregation. The correct (and only non-duplicated way) is to use colDef.rowGroupIndex and colDef.aggFunc.</li>
    <li>Major: New Column API method setColumnPinned().</li>
    <li>Major: api.refreshPivot() now called api.refreshRowGroup()</li>
    <li>Major: Event EVENT_COLUMN_PINNED_COUNT_CHANGED removed and EVENT_COLUMN_PINNED added.</li>
    <li>Major: Column getState() and setState() now include pinned state.</li>
    <li>Major: Header Height is now height per row, so if 25, and three column groups, total header height is 3x25 = 75. Before it was total header height (so height was split evenly across the header rows)</li>
    <li>Major: gridOptions.groupHeaders is no longer a property, as grouping in the headers is now defined inside the column definitions.</li>
    <li>Minor: CSS Classes ag-header-cell-grouped and ag-header-cell-not-grouped are no longer used.</li>
    <li>Major: colDef.headerGroupShow is now called colDef.columnGroupShow.</li>
    <li>Major: Icons {headerGroupOpened, headerGroupClosed} now called {columnGroupOpened, columnGroupClosed}</li>
    <li>Major: Column API - columnGroupOpened() renamed to setColumnGroupOpened()</li>
    <li>Major: setColumnVisible(key) now takes a 'key' which can be a colId, field, ColDef object or Column object - previously you had to provide a Column object. Also new method setColumnsVisible(listOfKeys) for updating batches of columns.</li>
    <li>Major: New methods setColumnPinned(key) and setColumnsPinned(listOfKeys) - behave similar to previously mentioned 'visible' methods</li>
    <li>Major: In get/set column state, pivotIndex is now called rowGroupIndex</li>
    <li>Major: If doing raw Javascript version, then angularGridGlobalFunction() is now deprecated, use "new ag.grid.Grid()" method instead.</li>
    <li>Major: checkboxSelection (on colDef) can now be a function, so you can use params in the function
        to work out at runtime if the cell should have a checkbox. gridOptions now also has function of the same
        name, so you can configure the grid to have a checkbox in the first column always regardless of the colDef
        (this is what the test drive does).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Version 2.3.7</h3>
    <li>Minor: Updated AngularJS 2 to version Beta 0. Example updated to show changes.</li>

    <h3>Version 2.3.5</h3>
    <li>Minor: Overlays can now be disabled via new properties suppressLoadingOverlay and suppressNoRowsOverlay.</li>

    <h3>Version 2.3.4</h3>
    <li>Bug fix: Template cache now working with IE9</li>
    <li>Bug fix: forEachNodeAfterFilter and forEachNodeAfterFilterAndSort were not working properly when grouping.</li>
    <li>Minor: Now set filter can take a comparator.</li>
    <li>Bug fix: Was not possible to add event listeners or set attributes to virtual elements after binding. This is now possible.</li>

    <h3>Version 2.3.3</h3>
    <li>Bug fix: Setting rowBuffer to zero did not work.</li>
    <li>Bug fix: Export to csv was not managing large exports.</li>
    <li>Minor: Moved Angular 2 examples to alpha 44.</li>

    <h3>Version 2.3.2</h3>
    <li>Bug fix: 'no rows' overlay was blocking column headers, so if showing, couldn't change filter.</li>

    <h3>Version 2.3.1</h3>
    <li>Bug fix: Angular 2 - EventEmitter for rowDeselected was missing.</li>
    <li>Major: Added getBusinessKeyForNode() method, to allow easily identifying of rows for automated testing.</li>
    <li>Minor: Removed declaration of 'module' and 'exports' in main.ts, so no longer clashes with node.ts typics.</li>
    <li>Minor: Fixed headerClass, array of classes was not working</li>

    <h3>Version 2.3.0</h3>
    <li>Major - Introduced 'no rows' message for when grid is empty.</li>
    <li>Major - Introduced custom overlays for 'no rows' and 'loading', so now they can be what you like.</li>
    <li>Major - Moved to AngularJS 2 alpha 38.</li>
    <li>Major - Took out auto loading of AngularJS 2 module with JSPM.</li>
    <li>Minor - Exposed global function for initialising Angular 1.x, to use if Angular not available on the global scope, eg using JSPM</li>
    <li>Minor - Bugfix - rowRenderer was not working when useEntireRow=true</li>

    <h3>Version 2.2.0</h3>
    <li>Major - Implemented 'destroy' API method, to release grids resources. Needed for Web Components and native
    Javascript (AngularJS lifecycle manages this for you).</li>
    <li>Major - Column resize events now have 'finished' flag, so if resizing, you know which event from a stream of
    'dragging' events is the final one.</li>
    <li>Major - New event: rowDeselected.</li>
    <li>Major - Now have 'customHeader' and 'customFooter' for export to csv.</li>
    <li>Minor - Now filters are positioned relative to their actual size instead of assuming each filter
                is 200px wide. Now wide filters don't fall off the edge of the grid.</li>
    <li>Minor - Bug fix #459 - getTopLevelNodes was called for not reason during filter initialisation which resulted in 'undefined' error for server side filtering</li>

    <h3>Version 2.1.3</h3>
    <li>Minor - Added header to Typescript definitions file and included in Definitely Typed</li>
    <li>Minor - Removed unused 'require' from agList - was conflicting when require defined elsewhere</li>
